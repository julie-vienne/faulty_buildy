# faulty_buildy

This repo is meant to detect fault in building operations captured in the following datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claytonmiller/lbnl-automated-fault-detection-for-buildings-data.

Using `main_analysis.ipynb`, one can train a classifier model (logistic regression, decision tree or mlp) on the six datasets and thereby detect faulty operations of the buildings in question.
